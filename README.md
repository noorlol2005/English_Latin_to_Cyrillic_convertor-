# English Latin to Cyrillic convertor 🇬🇧 🇺🇸 --> 🇷🇺 🇺🇦 🇧🇾 🇧🇬
The Cyrillic script is the official script in several countries in Europe and Asia (especially those under USSR's influence) like Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. This script that I have created in this program is used to help people who primarily use the Cyrillic script adapt more easily to the Latin script that is used in many parts of the world and by many languages incluidng English. 

The program converts English Latin script text to Cyrillic script.
